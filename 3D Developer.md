## 3D Developer

### Test
 - Create a automation script with UI to do the following
    - Ask the user to browse to a folder where blender file is stored
    - Export a 3D Scene in Blender with textures to a specific path (you can use export file format eg. fbx, gltf, usd, etc)
    - Zip the project zip which includes the project file, all textures and a HTML file with threeJs (eg. x:/export/samplescene.zip)
    - The HTML file should open the 3D scene in the browser without Blender
    - Add tests to test the code
    - Add a README.txt or .md with instructions to setup, run the tests and code, basic system requirements to run your code and some screenshots if possible
